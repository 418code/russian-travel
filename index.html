            According to Russian Public Opinion Research Center polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere, but only 36% plan to spend their holidays in their home country.
            What haven't we seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole universe with the gentle sea in ​​the south, the dense forests of the Sayan Mountains,
            and the harsh ice of the Putorana plateau. And you can also see all these beauties without millions in your bank, a foreign passport and long
            flights. For example, Vera Bashmakova - a brave young mother who took three children in her arms, made them sit in her "Lada"
            and drove 12.4 thousand miles through her native country. We have selected and described some interesting places worthy of your vacation.

                You can see two water horizons in the midst of forests and sand dunes

                into the tranquility of nature and the smell of the steel cool sea.

                Perhaps you were not interested in a super-deep well piercing the earth's crust, and apatites have long covered you with apathy.
                But your dream of seeing the northern lights begins to come true with a ticket to Murmansk.

                Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia. It is so primarily due to the mountains: if you go along the ridge,
                you will see slopes covered with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes. And if you open the windows in the car,
                you can get acquainted with the invisible miracle of these places - the mountain air.

                Altai has a moderate moderate, so it is best to go here in summer. This way you will see the whole variety of local flora and fauna.
                Elk roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. The famous Pallas' cat also inhabits the Altai Territory.

                Everyone knows Baikal as the largest lake in the world.
                It is quite known that this is the largest source of fresh water and one of the most beautiful places in Russia.

              <p class="place__paragraph">
                Of course, all of this is true. But Baikal is still an ideal place for skioring competitions.
                This is a sport where the skier ties himself to the motorcycle and the tandem tries to go as fast as possible on ice.
                A world record was set at the Baikal Mile festival in March 2019 - 122.42 mph.

              Siberia does not end in the Urals, but in Karelia: the Siberian larch that forms the taiga does not grow west of Vodlozero lake.
              But here it reaches 98 feet - the forests of the Karelian national parks have never known an ax because of the impenetrable swamps.
              Some pines are more than half a millennium old. You can touch a living creature that has seen the sun before Ivan the Terrible saw it.
              In the virgin forest you will not find a single trail for a hundred miles. There are bear claw markings a few feet from the ground on rare paths,
              so that everyone knows who is the boss here.
